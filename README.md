# Expo Constants.deviceId Inconsistency and Null Values on iOS

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, issue with Expo's `Constants.deviceId` API, particularly on iOS.  The `Constants.deviceId` is intended to provide a unique identifier for a user's device, but it can return inconsistent or null values under certain conditions.  This is a significant problem when implementing features that rely on persistent user data tied to a specific device.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` presents a more robust approach using alternative methods for device identification.

## Problem Description

The core issue is that `Constants.deviceId` is not always reliable. This is mostly noticeable when the app is closed and reopened, or if the app is backgrounded and then resumed. The value returned might change, or it might be null, rendering it unreliable for tasks that require a stable device ID.

## Solution

The provided solution introduces a more robust approach using a combination of techniques to generate a more consistent, device-specific identifier.  While a truly unique identifier is impossible without access to system-level APIs (restricted for privacy reasons), this solution provides a better alternative for most applications.

This solution employs asynchronous storage (such as AsyncStorage) to store the generated device identifier persistently. This ensures that the identifier remains consistent across app sessions.
